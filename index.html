    ## Bitmap vs vectorial

    **Two ways of represented an image:**
    1. Bitmap, which can be seen as "raster"
    2. Vector

    A bitmap is filled by pixels or dots

    ## Bitmap vs vectorial

    **Bitmap pictures: Photographs, digital, videos**

    - Number of dots (or pixels) defines through the height and width (160 x 120, 800 x 600, 1400 x 1050)
    - Or as dpi (dots per inches), ppi (pixels per inches)
    - Points are stretched or squashed when the size of the image changes
    - the number of points remains the same

    ???
    On utilise DPI or PPI quand la taille de l'image est déterminé en pouce, centimètre etc.

    ## Bitmap vs vectorial

    In Bitmap, each pixel has a specified color and detailed images are those with greater pixels.

    - Web = 72 dpi or ppi
    - color image >= 300 dpi or ppi
    - grayscale image >= 150 dpi or ppi

    **Some Bitmap programs:**
    - Photoshop (Expensive)
    - Paint Shop Pro (Expensive)
    - GIMP (FREE)
    - Photo-Paint (Expensive)
    - Graphic Converter

    ## What's a vectorial image?

    - Lines of computer instruction (code).
    - Instead of using pixels to describe the image, vectorial drawing use shapes:
      - Circles
      - Lines
      - Curves
    - The colors are included in the shapes
    - The quality remains the same regardless of the dimensions of the drawing

    ## Brief summary..

    **Use vectorial image means**..

    - Easily editable
    - Easy to handle
    - Rotation, color change, size, etc.
    - Uses less space than the bitmap

    **But**..

    - Uses a specific format, "svg"
    - Must be created / edited with specific software

    ## Chapter 2.
    # Colorimetry

    ???
    1. Ils éxistent plusieurs facon de représenter les couleurs.
    2. Je vais vour présenter deux d'entre-elles: RGB et CMYK
    3. Cette distinction est necessaire car la manière de représenté de la couleur à l'écran est différent de la couleur imprimé sur sur poster

    ## Printed or screen displayed?

    .pull-left[
    - Additive color model (Red + Green + Blue = White)
    - Visible spectrum
    - <span style='color:red;'>For computer display</span>
    - Use light to display color
    - Color result from transmitted light
    - ex. rgb(38, 157, 47); from 0 to 255
    ]
    --
    .pull-right[
    - Substractive color (Cyan + Magenta + Yellow + Black)
    - <span style='color:red;'>For printed materials</span>
    - Use ink to display color
    - Color result from reflected light
    - ex. cmyk(0.758, 0, 0.701, 0.384); from 0 to 1
    ]

    ## Printed image:

    You have to...

    --

    - **use the right model (CMYK or RGB)** of colors
    - make sure your **screen is calibrated**

    --

    ... to prevent this from happening on your poster, one day before your congress...

    ## Hex code for the web and R

    **Exemple in R**

    ```r
    plot(x,y, pch=19, col='#ff0000')
    ```

    --

    - **Hex** = hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG
    - Each digit ranging from 0 to F (16 possibilities)
    - Notation: `#RRGGBB`
    - `RR` = two digits = `\(16^2\)` = 256 nuances of one color

    See [http://www.color-hex.com/color/ff0000]([http://www.color-hex.com/color/ff0000]) for RGB to HEX conversion

    ## Bitmap and vector exports

    **Existing bitmap (or flatten vector) formats:**

    - jpg or jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
    - gif (Graphics Interchange Format)
    - png (Portable Network Graphics)
    - tiff (Tagged Image File Format)
    - pdf (Portable Document Format)

    --

    **Existing specific vector formats**: .svg, .eps, .pdf

    --

    For **bitmap or flatten vector**, the format determines:

    - Color depth (bbp)
    - Compression type
    - Transparency (PNG and GIF)
    - vectors or layers preserved and editable (PDF or native format .svg)
    - File size

    --

    **The format choice is a trade off among quality and file size (image definitions)**
