      ## Bitmap vs vectorial
      
      **Two ways of represented an image:**
      1. Bitmap, which can be seen as "raster"
      2. Vector
      
      A bitmap is filled by pixels or dots

      ## Bitmap vs vectorial

      **Bitmap pictures:**
      
      - Photographs, digital, videos
      - Number of dots (or pixels) defines : height, width (160 x 120, 800 x 600, 1400 x 1050)
      - Points are stretched or squashed when the size of the image changes
      - The number of points remains the same

      ## Bitmap vs vectorial

      Each pixel has a specified color and detailed images are those with greater pixels.
      
      **Some Bitmap programs:**
      - Photoshop (Expensive)
      - Paint Shop Pro (Expensive)
      - GIMP (FREE)
      - Photo-Paint (Expensive)
      - Graphic Converter

      ## What's a vectorial image?
      
      - Lines of computer instruction (code).
      - Instead of using pixels to describe the image, vectorial drawing use shapes: 
        - Circles
        - Lines
        - Curves
      - The colors are included in the shapes
      - The quality remains the same regardless of the dimensions of the drawing

      ## Brief summary..
      
      **Use vectorial image means**..
      
      - Easily editable
      - Easy to handle
      - Rotation, color change, size, etc.
      - Uses less space than the bitmap
      
      **But**..
      
      - Uses a specific format, "svg"
      - Must be created / edited with specific software

      ## Magnetism
      
      **Used to make objects and path "sticky"**
      - Objects and paths are attracted to each other (corners, environment, etc.) 
      - Can be enabled or disabled
